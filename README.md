# Ball Prediction using Kalman Filter
This repository contains a real-time ball tracking and prediction system using OpenCV, NumPy, and a Kalman Filter for motion estimation. The project captures video input, detects an object based on color segmentation, and applies a Kalman Filter to predict its trajectory.
